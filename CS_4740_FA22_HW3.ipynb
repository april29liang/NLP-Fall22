        "Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is the task of automatically labelling the semantic roles of each argument according to each predicate in a passage. **Predicates** (e.g., bought, sell, purchasing) represent events, and each sentence can have more than one predicate. **Semantic roles** express the abstract roles that predicate arguments can take in the event. Typical semantic arguments include Agent, Patient, and Instrument, and also adjunctive arguments indicating Locative, Temporal, Manner, Cause, and other aspects. Recognizing and labeling semantic arguments is a key task for answering \"Who\", \"When\", \"What\", \"Where\", and \"Why\" questions in Information Extraction, Question Answering, Summarization, and, in general, in all NLP tasks in which some kind of semantic interpretation is needed.\n",
