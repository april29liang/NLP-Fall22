    "In this project, you will tackle the **Named Entity Recognition** task: you'll implement models that identify named entities in text and tag them with the appropriate label. A primer on this task is provided further on.  We will treat this as a **sequence-tagging task**: for each token in the input text, assign one of the following 5 entity labels -- **ORG** (Organization), **PER** (Person), **LOC** (Location), **MISC** (Miscellaneous), and **O** (Not Named Entity) -- as well as a BIO-format prefix **B-** (token is the *beginning* of a named entity) or **I-** (token is *inside* a named entity). Overall, this yields 9 different labels: **B-ORG, I-ORG, B-PER, I-PER, B-LOC, I-LOC, B-MISC, I-MISC** and **O**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you will implement two sequence labeling approaches:\n",
    "- Model 1 : a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)\n",
    "- Model 2 : a Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM)/Logistic Regression classifier (also known as a MaxEnt classifier). Feature engineering is strongly suggested for this model!\n",
    "\n",
    "A key component of both models is implementation of the Viterbi algorithm, which we will use to find the most likely tag sequence to assign to an input text."

    "In this part of the assignment, you will:\n",
    "1. Implement code for counting and smoothing of labels and words, as well as unkown word handing, as necessary to support the Viterbi algorithm. \n",
    "2. Build a Hidden Markov Model in accordance with the provided function headers. **You may NOT change the function specifications.** Please ensure that your code is clear, concise, and, most important of all, modular. This means you should break your implementation down into smaller functions or write it within a class. Please compute all probabilities in natural log when building the HMM.\n",
    "3. Implement the **Viterbi algorithm**, that can be used to infer token-level labels (identifying the appropriate named entity) for an input document. This process is commonly referred to as **decoding**. Bigram-based Viterbi is $ \\mathcal{O}(sm^2)$ where *s* is the length of the sentence and *m* is the number of tags. Your implementation should have similar efficiency. The code for this can be used later on for the MEMM too.\n",

    "The first part is unknown word handling. In our algorithm, we choose the second alternative listed in Jurafsky and Martin's book. The main idea is to replace the words in training data with <unk> based on their frequency. Since the frequency distribution is skewed, we didn't replace words whose frequency is smaller than a certain value. Most of the words have 1 or 2 frequencies, but some common words like \"the\" and \"a\" and large frequencies. Using certain values to replace words with <unk> will make us lose a lot of informative words. Thus, we choose to replace words based on quantiles like the last 20%. The function is named `unknown_word_handling(tokens,percent)`. The input has two parameters, one is the original document text and the other is the quantile. <br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Then we start to build three main parts of the Viterbi algorithm. <br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "The first part is generating the transition matrix. The function is named `build_transition_matrix(labels, k)` . The transition probability is the probability of one tag depending on the given previous tag, which is ``P(tag1|tag2)``. Also, to specify the end state, we choose to append a [end] tag at the end of the sentence. Since some of the tag combinations will have 0 occurrences and the logarithm for 0 doesn't exist, we try to smooth this probability by adding a specific value k.<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "The second part is generating the emission matrix. The function is named `build_emission_matrix(tokens, labels, k)`. The emission probability is the probability of one word depending on a given tag, which is `P(word|tag)`. We also include a <end> word in the word lists to specify the end state and include k to smooth the 0 probabilities. Since there is a (<end>,[end]) combination, we assigned log(1) to this probability and it will not affect the result. <br>\n",
    "The third part is generating the start state. The function is named `get_start_state_probs(labels, k)`. We need to get q0 in the Viterbi chart. The start probability is the probability of each tag appearing at the beginning of a sentence. <br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "In the function `build_hmm(tokens, labels)`, we input the training labels and tokens, as well as call the three functions above to return the matrices that are needed by the Viterbi algorithm. Also, in this function, we can specify different smoothing parameters k. The output is the unzipped label list, token list, start probabilities, transition matrix, and emission matrix. <br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "After that, we input all of the above to build a Viterbi algorithm called viterbi(hmm, observation). The parameter observation is the actual test/validation data and hmm is the inputs from the build_hmm() function. We initialized a table to store all probabilities and states recorded in each step. Also, we use the same logic as above the deal with unknown words that appear in the test data. The start state is the start probabilities times the first words’ emission probabilities. In the loops, each iteration we compare the probabilities of previous step times emission and transition probabilities. Then, we create a list ` choice` to record each step’s best choice tags and the maximized probabilities. \n"

In our model, this table shows that the PER tags have the best performance, with the highest F1 score of 0.699, the recall of 0.563, the precision of 0.923.

The ORG tags have the worst performance, with the lowest F1 score of 0.466, the recall of 0.368 and the precision of 0.636.

    "  * While there are many directions to take when looking for features, you may start by exploring parts of speech that appear in sentences. There are several libraries (ex.

    "\n",
    "    2.1 feature extractions for training data: The output data structure is a list of tuples with the first element be the feature dictionary and the second element be the NER label. We looped through every word in every sentence in the data. And then first check for features about the word itself, like captalization, pos_is_NNP, is_loc, etc. Then check if the word is sentence initial, if not, we check the previous word and the NER of previous word. Then if the sentence length > 1 and the current word is not the last element in the sentence, we check the next word of it to see if it is in the next_word list which includes 'University', 'War', 'League', 'Mountains'.\n",
    "\n",

Unlike the training feature extraction, it takes more input: the current single word, its part-of-speech, the NER of previous word, the previous word, and the next word. The MEMM viterbi will produce those inputs to be used in this function. Then the function maps all the input into the feature dictionary.\n",

    "4. MEMM implementation: We modified viterbi from last HMM section. Since we do not have start probability anymore, we initialize the table by calling the test_feature_extract on the first element and then use the classifier from ME model to generate the probability distribution for each NER label. Then we have three loops, 1. iterate the observation from the second word to the end; 2. iterate all NER for each row; 3. iterate all NER again for each possible previous NER. Then we check all inputs for test_feature_extract and then extract feature for every word. Then the ME classifier was used to calculated the probability distribution for each NER label. We use the probability distribution to update the table. So instead of log(emission) + log(transition) in HMM, we only have one single log(ME_probability) in MEMM.

Even if we inspect the previous tag and previous special words, we still don't include enough meaningful context information. The model cannot learn much from the existing context. However, recording every word as a feature is costly. To save time and energy, we think that isn't a good way to improve. In the future, maybe there are some ways to include the context information more and cost less. Also, we only inspect some part of the training data, and we decided to add features like \"pre_at\",\"pre_of\",\"pre_University\" and so on. There should be some other rules that we didn't notice. By inspecting the document and adding more meaningful word lists like prefixs, suffixs, or alias, the system may be improved. <br> \n",

One thing needs to be noted is that the best f1 score for MEMM was after 100 iteration which is extremely time-consuming while HMM did not take very long time to be trained. \n",
    "\n",
    "One reason is that our feature selection may not be good enough. We found that adding more features sometime decreases the accuracy of model performance. It is possible that we added some features that are not important to learn the labels or even further confuse the models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason is the overfitting issue. In the training phase, we got accuracy around 0.980, but the F1 score on validation data is not as good. Since we were choosing our own features based on the training dataset which describe the training data very well but not necessay can capture the test data, it is very easy to get overfitting issue."
